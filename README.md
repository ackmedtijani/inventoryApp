# SME Inventory Management Application

This is a small scale inventory application I'm developing for my mum's SME. It's ultra specific to hard product catalogue and inventory. 

It's a fullstack app built with Django, Vanilla CSS and JS. Further versions will be implemented with Vue and backend implemented with the DRSF. 

The app is yet to be completed especially on the frontend side. The filter and sorting options are yet to be fully implemented. Due to other engagements, I don't have the time to complete it yet.
